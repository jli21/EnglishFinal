				The Pre-Colonial Times was a time period that was filled with adventurous voyagers and intrepid explorers; pioneers in a new world with plenty of opportunity. There were many different groups, including the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, the French fur traders, and the English settlers. Each group had a different culture and background, and each contributed to the modern ideals of America in their own way. However, all of these groups had one thing in common: a reason for leaving their established lives behind and traveling to the New World. For almost everyone who traveled to the New World, the reason for it was either Glory, God, or Gold. These early settlers lay down the groundwork for the nation that would become modern America, and their impact upon the modern American culture and society is undeniable. The three factors of glory, god, and gold compelled them to establish a new country where their values in each of these three ideas was an important part of their society, and the society today.
				<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
				One of the most important factors as to why people came to the New World from Europe was glory. Many people in Europe wanted to make a name for themselves, and discover unexplored lands or subjugate primitive people. They desired to have glory greater than anyone else, and go down in the books as one of the great people of history. One easy way to gain fame was to become an explorer for one’s nation. In particular, Spain sent many different glory-seeking explorers to the New World in order to find new people and discover new lands. One such example of this was Hernan Cortes, who conquered the Aztec Empire in 1522, and another example of this was Francisco Pizarro, who conquered the Aztec Empire in 1532 (Danzer, 2009). Both of these men are still remembered today for their exploits across South and Central America, and both of them greatly contributed to the culture today. This glory that they received was one of the reasons why so many people came to the New World. The competition between countries for a piece of the New World meant that it wasn’t only an economic matter, but also a matter of their pride. Countries sent explorers such as Hudson, Cartier, Cabot, Verrazano, Columbus, Coronado, and Vespucci out to discover and claim land in the country’s name in order to gain glory (Danzer, 2009). However, this also had other consequences on modern American culture. This fanatical rush for land in New World caused a plethora of different cultures and values to build up in America, and is the reason why America is not Spanish, or British, or French, but a combination of all of these. The efforts of people and nations seeking glory in the New World led, in part, to the unique culture America has at this moment.
				<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
				Another important force that caused many people to come to the New World was God. At this time in history, religion and God played an important role in the lives of many people. Everything that happened to a person was believed to be the work of God, as shown in an excerpt from La Relacion, about the expedition to the New World by Alvaro Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, where the narrator notes that “After four days a storm came up and caused the other boat to be lost. We did not sink because of God’s great mercy” (de Vaca, 1542). Demonstrated in this case, where the explorer and the members of his expedition turning to religion even in the face of death, religion was an important part of their culture and it was integrated into American culture later. In addition to de Vaca’s accounts, many other groups also had deeply religious feelings, such as the English settlers. In her narrative, Mary Rowlandson writes about how she was captured by Indians, and when she fled and returned to her people safely, she “[could not] but admire at the wonderful power and goodness of God to [her], in that thought [she] was gone from home, and met with all sorts of Indians, and those [she] had no knowledge of, and there being no Christian soul near [her]; yet not one of them offered the least imaginable miscarriage to [her].” (Rowlandson, 1682). Even when faced with extreme danger, these people turn to God and their religion showing how deeply it is ingrained into their lives. Europe was also going through religious turmoil at this time, and new leaders such as Martin Luther and John Calvin had created new ideas that denounced the Catholic Church. Persecution of other faiths was widespread and many Europeans held bigoted attitudes to those they viewed as heretics or heathens. In fact, in the excerpt from La Relacion, the narrator comments, “When their crying ceased, I told the Christians that, if they agreed, I would ask those Indians to take us to their lodges.”, showing the gaping difference in the narrator’s mind between the natives and the spaniards (de Vaca, 1542). Indeed, many Europeans viewed the natives as a different race, and of a totally different species due them simply not being christian. Due to the incredible nature of a multitude of religions converging on one place, the New World, and the devout belief settlers and explorers had in their religions, it is not a surprise that America is still a very religious place today, with numerous religions across the country, and that religion still causes conflict among people today in this country. 
				<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
				One of the most important causes for people coming to the Americas was for gold. Gold, or money, is one of the biggest motivators for the human race. Even today, people still will do almost anything to get rich, as money symbolizes power and social status in society. During the early period before the colonial times, this was the same way. Many people only came to the Americas to get rich. The Spanish built an empire for themselves, but had almost no one living there with the exception of natives. The reason they wanted all that land was for the gold and silver buried beneath it in places like Peru, Argentina, Mexico, and the Southwest United States (Danzer, 2009). In addition to the Spanish, the French also came to the New World with the intention of striking it rich, but ended up in Canada instead. There, they took advantage of the fur trade to make their money. They opted for a more peaceful strategy with the natives than the Spanish or English, and sent negotiators to establish trade. One such famous ambassador was Nicolas Perrot, who was chronicled to have conducted deals with the Potawatomi and Outagamie tribes, and in a story, it describes, “And, as the beaver was valued by his people, he wished to ascertain whether there were not a good opportunity for them to carry on trade therein.” (La Potherie, 1701). This shows the desire of the French to trade simple materials such as guns and iron to the natives in exchange for fur, which was much more valuable. The value of money to growing empires such as England, France, and Spain was of utmost importance, and in addition, many of the people who went to the New World were seeking a personal fortune for themselves. This nature contributed heavily to the current culture today, especially the  economic ideology that is prevalent in modern America. Using capitalism, everyone wants to make their own money and can get rich from nothing, which is from the ideas of people centuries ago who came to America in order to get rich. The United States economy would look drastically different if it were not for the Europeans who came to America looking for gold. 
				<br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
				The motivators of god, glory, and gold caused many to come to the Americas in order to fulfill their dreams, and change the culture of the United States of America forever. Ideas about glory and prestige created a diverse and unique nation, while devout religious supporters contributed to the religious nature of society now, and the concept of gold being all important had a major impact on the economic beliefs most Americans wield today. and since these were the first people to settle in America, These settlers had the unique ability to change the ideas and destiny of America for many centuries due to the enormous impact they had on modern culture, society, and they way people think.
