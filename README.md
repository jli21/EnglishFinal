Course Research Project
UC AIT English 2 - Early American Literature


Welcome to my class! During this exciting academic journey, we will analyze the writings and lives of the people inhabiting early America in order to explore the impact that its past has had on the modern American nation. Each unit of study focuses on a key question that helps us explore this topic.

As evidence of your learning, you will create a product that demonstrates your thoughtful and informed opinion on how the early Americans’ pursuit of glory, God, and gold shaped modern American society. To encourage your enjoyment of this ongoing assignment, you may choose the format and medium of your product. However, your product must do the following:
offer your personal, informed opinion on how early Americans’ pursuit of glory, God, and gold shaped modern American society;
address each and every time period covered in the course--precolonial, colonial, first industrial revolution, antebellum, Civil War and Reconstruction, and westward expansion--;
provide specific supporting details from course texts;
capitalize on credible and appropriate academic research;
explain the relationship between overarching position, main ideas, points, and evidence;
adhere to American English language conventions and American Psychological Association guidelines as appropriate for the chosen medium and format; as well as
have professional production value.

You also will have three graded checkpoints throughout the school year:
project pitch: a multimedia presentation describing and defending your intended product format and medium;
product sample: a treatment of a unit of study using your proposed or revised product format and medium;
product reflection: a multimedia presentation evaluating the effectiveness of product sample in meeting project parameters and suggesting as needed revisions to the product format to ensure meeting all project parameters.
The product sample will count as your midterm examination grade, and the project pitch and product reflection will count as assessment grades in M1 and M3 respectively.

I highly recommend that you maintain an informal record of your efforts on this research project to ensure accurate reporting of progress and help me offer you meaningful feedback on your efforts as well as coming to English Help once a month to review your progress with me. These recommendations give you the accountability and extra support that prime you for success on a long-term project; however, they are not graded assignments.

I truly look forward to working with you throughout the year and offering your opportunities to develop your critical reading, academic writing, collaboration, and public speaking skills. Please do not hesitate to speak with me during English Help or reach out to me via email if you have any questions about this project.
